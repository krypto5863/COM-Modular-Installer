# Support

If you're in need of support, ideally you can receive realtime support in the Custom Maid Discord server. From there, simply ask in a support channel or feel free to ping the author, 𝕺𝖙𝖕𝖞𝖗𝖐#1133.

If you prefer to avoid Discord entirely, please leave an issue post in the CMI's [Issues Page](https://github.com/krypto5863/COM-Modular-Installer/issues).
