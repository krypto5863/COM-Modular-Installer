# COM Modular Installer
This repo is dedicated to the COM Modular Installer. An installer built in Inno and using a C# library to extend functions.

Ever since the CM3d2 Days, I maintained a very spiffy and personalized Sybaris folder. I knew exactly what plugins were in there, what I wanted and what I didn't want. When COM came around, the number of plugins and patchers became too great to feasibly build without taking away some serious time. Eventually, I got tired of the extra plugins I wouldn't use and the files that felt like bloat to me, so I made this.

-Modular

-Clean

-Flexible

-BepinEX Enabled (USE BEPINEX FOR CHRIST'S SAKE. IT'S GOOD. BETTER THAN SYBARIS.)

-Easy to uninstall

-Easy to upgrade

-Can even be used to get single plugins since every component is optional.

-Very Filled

Any information related to the various plugins and components can be located in the readme included. Basic troubleshooting information and hotkey lookups can also be found there.

This installer was made in Inno Setup by Kryp- I mean... The Doctor! Any problems, DM or ping @ùï∫ùñôùñïùñûùñóùñê#1133 on the meido discord server!

All of the assets used were made by their respective authors, I take credit for nothing but the installer.
