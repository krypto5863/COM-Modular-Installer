# How To Download

Many people get confused when downloading CMI and may end up downloading the source code of the repo. If you're a normal user, this won't do anything for you. Please refer to the image below on what file you should be downloading!

Once you know what you're doing, proceed to the release page! However, be sure you **give the readme a read**, either before or during your installation of CMI!
